Hi Madam,
 
Its been an extraordinary journey of about 5 years in HTC. I have travelled a long from a fresh graduate to a finely tuned professional, from a raw learner to a good trainer, from an enthusiastic individual to influential team player. Though it is not a spring ride all through, I was comfortable in every single minute just with the confidence on extraordinary team backing me. At times, I fell on my way, but every time either you pushed me up or the hope that you are behind me, made me bounce up. At times, I saw road of roses, I know you are the reason. But now the time arrived, situations demanded, to take off my wings and to see the new heights on my way, leaving the comforts, supports and taking the knowledge, values from this wonderful abode. 
 
I thank every one of my team who cherished me every day. I thank every body who made me laugh, made me learn, made me teach, eventually made me change the way I take up things, share things and even forget things.
 
Kindly relieve me as soon as possible. 
 
With eternal gratitude for your unmatchable support, 
Vamsikrishna Sannareddy.
